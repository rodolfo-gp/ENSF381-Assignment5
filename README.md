# Website and Server Project

## Project By
- **Rodolfo Gil-Pereira**

## Description
This project features a shopping website developed using ReactJS, paired with a backend server implemented with Python Flask. The website communicates with the backend through API requests for authentication and sign-up processes. The backend validates the submitted information against its JSON file database and responds accordingly. Key features of the website include user login, sign-up, page navigation protection requiring authentication, and a shopping cart that retains selected products. The backend also serves product information, which the website queries to display relevant product details.

## Instructions
To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Setup**: 
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Follow the instructions in the `readme.txt` file within the `backend` directory to set up and run the Flask server.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Open a separate terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Follow the instructions in the `readme.txt` file within the `frontend` directory to set up and run the ReactJS application.

Ensure that both the backend and frontend are running simultaneously to enable full functionality, including authentication, sign-up, and product page features.
